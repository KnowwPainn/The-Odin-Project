        <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>

        <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Absolute links, likt to
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.or/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" 
                target="_blank">Mozilla
                Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for Web
                developers.</li>
            <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras
                page</a>.</li>
            <li>Root-Relative Links</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may
            also be interested in <a href="links.html">links</a> or
            <a href="images.html">images</a>.
