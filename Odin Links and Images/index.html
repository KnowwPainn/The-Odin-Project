    <!-- Using the <a> aka the anchor tag to make it a link.
        the 'href'(hypertext reference) gives out anchor tag 
        a direction to point to by connecting a url to it.
        The _blank makes it open in a new window instead of in the 
        window the user is currently own which is does by default if
        the _blank is not set.  -->

        <img src=" ./images/dog.jpg" alt="Picture of a 
        dog" height="510" width="510">
        <!-- Make sure to put 'alt' after an image tag
             for the tag to be considered valid. This way if 
             if the image doesnt load it show the alt txt.
             Make sure it is as clear as possible. -->
